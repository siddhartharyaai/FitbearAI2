The AI engineer's work involved an extensive series of bug fixes and architectural refinements to transform the Fitbear AI application into a production-ready system. Initial efforts focused on resolving a Netlify build failure, functional issues (demo mode, image uploads, voice integration), and a critical repository size problem that prevented GitHub saves. This led to a complete Git history cleanup. Subsequently, the engineer addressed multiple Netlify deployment failures related to  parsing, invalid Node.js versions, and persistent frontend build errors stemming from TypeScript type mismatches and module import issues. A major overhaul targeted the Complete Profile flow, initially fixing a 404 API error by creating missing API routes and correcting client-side authentication, then redesigning it as a non-blocking popup. The latest critical findings, after comprehensive end-to-end testing of the deployed app, reveal that both frontend and backend are still completely broken on Netlify, primarily due to incorrect Supabase configuration and API routes not being deployed as serverless functions.

<product_requirements>
The Fitbear AI is an Indian-first PWA for health/fitness/nutrition, offering an empathetic Coach C (chat + voice, English/Hinglish), Menu Scanner (OCR), Meal Photo Analyzer, 5-step Onboarding (BPS), personalized daily Targets, Logs/History, and user Settings. M0 success requires an end-to-end happy path (onboard → targets → scan menu → picks → log → coach reply → history), fast performance, robust data safety, and accessibility. The product demands a production deployment with real data, real OCR/LLM (Gemini), Deepgram voice, profile CRUD, and no demo data. The Complete Profile flow has been a recurring issue, with the latest request to simplify it into an optional popup, allowing app usage even if the profile is incomplete.

- ****: Still serves as a catch-all, but specific routes were extracted.
- ** & **: **Newly created** for handling user profile and daily targets CRUD operations. They use  and  and integrate with MongoDB for data persistence, requiring Bearer token authentication.
- ****: Handles Supabase authentication redirects. **Updated** for proper Supabase SSR cookie handling.
- ****: The main frontend entry point. **Heavily refactored** for email/password auth, integrating , adding auth gates, and dynamically rendering components based on authentication state. **Crucially updated** to fix a bug where it bypassed the sign-in page, now forcing authentication. Also updated to include the .

- ****: **Newly created** component for simplified profile setup (Name, Height, Weight, Activity Level, Vegetarian). Designed as a non-blocking popup.
- ****: Server-side authentication utility. **Updated**  to correctly verify user via Bearer token/cookie and to handle missing Supabase environment variables gracefully.
- ****: Manages app mode and mock behavior. **Fixed** a TypeScript type annotation issue in a JS file.
- ****: **Newly created** MongoDB client helper for connecting to MongoDB Atlas, handling missing  gracefully for development.

<pending_tasks>
- Research and fix Supabase authentication configuration (placeholder URLs in current deployed app).
- Resolve persistent API deployment issues (502 errors on deployed Netlify app, indicating backend functions are not properly configured/deployed).
- Re-deploy to Netlify after fixing the above issues.
- Conduct thorough end-to-end user journey testing on the deployed Netlify app to verify all features.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer had just completed a major overhaul of the Complete Profile system and addressed a critical authentication flow bug. The user explicitly requested to simplify the profile section, making it a non-blocking popup, and ensuring the app is usable without profile completion.

The engineer implemented the following:
- **Removed Complex Onboarding**: The previous 5-step wizard () was removed as a blocking step.
- **Created Simple Profile Popup**: A new component, , was created with just essential fields (Name, Height, Weight, Activity Level, Vegetarian preference). This is now a non-blocking popup, allowing users to Skip for now.
- **App Usable Without Profile**: The  was modified to ensure all main tabs (Scanner, Photo, Coach, History) are accessible immediately after authentication, irrespective of profile completion. A notification banner now suggests profile setup.
- **Fixed Authentication Flow Bug**: A critical bug in  was resolved where the app was bypassing the sign-in page and directly loading the profile completion. The logic  was corrected to  and explicit  calls were added for unauthenticated states.

Despite these local fixes and a successful local build, comprehensive frontend testing on the *deployed Netlify app* (https://fitbearai.netlify.app/) revealed severe issues:
1.  **Frontend Completely Broken**: The app displays Application error: a client-side exception has occurred due to .
2.  **Backend Completely Broken**: All 12 API endpoints are failing with  HTML responses, indicating Netlify Functions are not deployed, or  is misconfigured.

The current work concludes with the AI engineer identifying these two critical, persistent issues on the deployed application, which prevent real-world usage.
