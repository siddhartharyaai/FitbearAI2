The previous AI engineer undertook a comprehensive mission to transform the Fitbear AI application into a production-ready system. Initially, the engineer addressed a Netlify build failure related to a missing Supabase client and a series of functional issues, including demo mode behavior, image uploads, and voice integration. However, early self-reporting of success was invalidated by the user, leading to a critical self-correction. The engineer then received a highly detailed Production Cutover mission, focusing on switching to email/password authentication, eliminating all mock data, integrating real Deepgram voice and Gemini OCR, and hardening Netlify deployment. The engineer systematically implemented these changes, created new routes (, , ), updated existing ones, refined environment variable handling, and set up a CI workflow. The process involved fixing import paths (e.g.,  to ), installing dependencies, and performing local smoke tests. The most recent interaction involved the user reporting an inability to save to GitHub, which led the engineer to diagnose and clean up large  and  directories by creating a  file.

<product_requirements>
The Fitbear AI is an Indian-first, web-first PWA designed for Indian consumers with mixed diets and intermittent connectivity, aiming to be a free-first health/fitness/nutrition assistant. Key features include an empathetic, personalized Coach C (chat + voice) supporting English/Hinglish, a Menu Scanner using OCR, a Meal Photo Analyzer, a comprehensive 5-step Onboarding (BPS), personalized daily Targets (TDEE, macros, hydration, steps), Logs/History with evening check-ins, and user Settings. The M0 success criteria demand an end-to-end happy path (onboard → targets → scan menu → picks → log → coach reply → history), fast performance, robust data safety (RLS, server-side secrets, no PII), and accessibility. The product requires a production deployment with real data, real OCR/LLM, Deepgram voice, profile CRUD, and no demo data.

    -   **Summary**: Dedicated API endpoint for Coach C interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Extracted from the  route. Configured to use Gemini 2.5 Flash for responses, exports , .
-   ** & **:
    -   **Summary**: Dedicated API endpoints for meal photo analysis and menu scanning.
    -   **Changes**: Extracted from . Enforce  for image uploads, return 400 JSON on missing files, use  for production guards, and call Gemini Vision 2.5 Flash for actual image processing. Both export , .
-   ** & **:
    -   **Summary**: Dedicated API endpoints for Deepgram Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text.
    -   **Changes**: Refined to match exact Deepgram API specifications, returning  for TTS and  for STT. Both export , .

    -   **Summary**: The main frontend entry point.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to switch from OTP/magic link authentication to email/password, integrate  for client-side auth, add a Profile link and a Sign out button in the header navigation, and use Bearer tokens for API calls.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Dedicated page for user profile view and edit.
    -   **Changes**: Fully implemented for CRUD operations on BPS fields, fetches from , and saves via  request with Bearer token authentication.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had completed a comprehensive Production Cutover mission. This involved:
- Switching Supabase authentication from OTP/magic link to email/password in  and .
- Implementing server-side authentication with Bearer token support in  for API protection.
- Eliminating all hardcoded demo/mock data from  and dedicated routes.
- Hardening API routes (, , , , ) to enforce FormData, production guards ( in ), and Node.js runtime flags.
- Adding a Profile link and Sign out button to the main UI.
- Setting up a CI workflow () and test fixtures ().
- Verifying local smoke tests that confirmed production mode (), health checks, and production guards for API endpoints.

The work was temporarily paused when the user reported being unable to save to GitHub. The engineer diagnosed this as a repository size issue due to untracked  and  directories. The current work involved creating a  file and executing  to clean up these files from Git tracking. The next step was to verify the repository size and attempt to commit the clean-up changes.
